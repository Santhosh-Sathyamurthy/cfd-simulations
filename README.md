# cfd-simulations

**Learning and implementing CFD simulations using Julia and Python.**

This repository includes exploratory codes, practice scripts, and foundational implementations of flow problems using a variety of numerical methods. The focus is on learning and experimentation across several core CFD techniques.

## ðŸ”§ Features

- Discretization techniques: Finite Volume, Finite Difference, and Finite Element Methods
- Compressible and incompressible flow solvers
- Time-dependent and steady-state simulations
- Structured and unstructured mesh methods
- Educational case studies and numerical experiments
- Performance-aware coding (Numba, multi-threaded Julia, etc.)
